Git stores the version history in a hidden folder .git which is made when we initialize it using git init command.
The folder is hidden and to view it we have to use ls-a command which is used to view hidden files in a folder.

The repository is the .git folder inside our project folder. It will track all the changes made to the files in our project and record it over time.
